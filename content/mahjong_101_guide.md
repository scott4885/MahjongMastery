- When and how to expose tiles
- Joker rules that actually make sense
- Beginner winning strategies
- Dallas Mahjong (blanks) variation

**By the end of this guide, you'll be ready to sit down at any table and play with confidence.**

Let's get started!

---

## CHAPTER 1: WHAT AMERICAN MAHJONG IS (AND WHAT IT IS NOT)

### The Core Concept

American Mahjong is a **tile-based rummy game** for four players where you:
1. Choose a hand from the official card
2. Collect tiles to match that hand pattern
3. Complete your hand and call "Mahjong!"

### It's NOT:
- Chinese Mahjong (different rules, different scoring)
- A luck-only game (strategy matters enormously)
- Impossible to learn (you can play your first game today!)

### Three Things Make American Mahjong Unique:

**1. The NMJL Card**
Every year, the National Mah Jongg League publishes a card with ~50 winning hand patterns. You choose one and build toward it.

**2. Jokers (Wild Tiles)**
Jokers can substitute for any tile in your hand—except in specific situations (we'll cover this).

**3. The Charleston**
Before play begins, you pass tiles to other players. This is your chance to improve your starting hand.

### Your Goal Every Game:
Be the first to complete a winning hand pattern from the card.

---

## CHAPTER 2: YOUR EQUIPMENT + SETUP

### The Tiles (166 Total)

**THREE SUITS (36 each = 108 total):**

**Dots** - Circles in various arrangements
- 1-9, four copies of each number

**Bams** - Bamboo sticks
- 1-9, four copies of each number
- Note: 1 Bam often looks like a bird

**Craks** - Chinese characters with numbers
- 1-9, four copies of each number

**HONORS (28 total):**

**Winds (16 tiles)**
- East, South, West, North
- Four of each wind

**Dragons (12 tiles)**
- Red Dragon (紅)
- Green Dragon (發)
- White Dragon (often blank or framed)
- Four of each dragon

**BONUS TILES (30 total):**

**Flowers (8 tiles)**
- Usually numbered 1-8
- Often have floral artwork

**Jokers (8-10 tiles)**
- Marked "JOKER" or special symbol
- Your wild cards!

### The Racks
- Each player has a rack to hold their 13-14 tiles
- Angled racks make it easier to see your hand

### The Dice
- Two dice (sometimes four)
- Used to determine who breaks the wall

### The NMJL Card
- Published annually (buy new each year)
- Contains all valid winning hands
- Organized by section/category

### Optional Accessories:
- Chips/money (for scoring)
- Pushers (help build walls)
- Wind indicator
- Card holders

---

## CHAPTER 3: TILE CATEGORIES (BEGINNER CHEAT SHEET)

Understanding tile terminology is essential for reading the card.

### Singles, Pairs, Pungs, and Kongs

**Single:**
- One tile
- Example: 3 Dot

**Pair:**
- Two identical tiles
- Example: 5 Crak, 5 Crak

**Pung:**
- Three identical tiles
- Example: North Wind, North Wind, North Wind

**Kong:**
- Four identical tiles
- Example: 2 Bam, 2 Bam, 2 Bam, 2 Bam

### Runs (Sequential Tiles)
- Three or more tiles in numerical order from the same suit
- Example: 4-5-6 Dots

**Important:** Runs MUST be the same suit
- 4-5-6 Dots = Valid
- 4 Dot, 5 Bam, 6 Crak = Invalid

### Like Numbers
- Same number across different suits
- Example: 7 Dot, 7 Bam, 7 Crak

### Suits vs. Honors
- **Suits:** Dots, Bams, Craks (have numbers 1-9)
- **Honors:** Winds and Dragons (no numbers)
- Some hands use only suits, some mix suits and honors

---

## CHAPTER 4: THE NMJL CARD - HOW TO READ IT

The card looks intimidating at first, but it's actually very logical.

### Card Structure

**Sections (Categories):**
Each year's card has ~8-10 sections, such as:
- 2468
- Consecutive Run
- 13579
- Winds & Dragons
- Year (specific to current year)
- Singles & Pairs
- Quints

Each section contains 4-6 hand patterns.

### How to Read a Hand Pattern

Hands are written in shorthand. Here's how to decode them:

**Example hand:** 
**DDDD 111 222 333**

**What this means:**
- DDDD = Four dragons (any dragon—you pick)
- 111 = Three ones (1-1-1 of any suit)
- 222 = Three twos (2-2-2 of any suit)
- 333 = Three threes (3-3-3 of any suit)

**Translation:** You need four dragons (all the same) and three pungs of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

### Common Card Symbols:

- **Parentheses ()** = Optional/can be different suits
- **Capital letters (DDDD, FF, NEWS)** = Honors
  - D = Dragon
  - F = Flower
  - N = North, E = East, W = West, S = South
- **Numbers** = Tile values
- **Spaces** = Separate groups
- **Same line = Same suit**

### Beginner Tip:
Start by looking at hands that use "Any Like Numbers" or "One Suit + Dragons" patterns. These are usually easier to complete.

## CHAPTER 5: THE DEAL + STARTING THE GAME

### Seating

**Determine seats randomly:**
1. Each player draws a Wind tile
2. Arrange yourselves: East, South, West, North (clockwise)
3. East is the dealer for the first game

### Building the Walls

**Each player:**
1. Takes 34-36 tiles (depending on variations)
2. Arranges them face-down in a wall
3. Wall is 17 tiles long × 2 tiles high
4. Place your wall in front of your rack

**The four walls form a square in the center of the table.**

### Breaking the Wall

1. East rolls both dice
2. Count counter-clockwise from East (1 = East, 2 = South, etc.)
3. The player indicated rolls again
4. Count that many stacks from the right end of THAT player's wall
5. Break the wall at that point

### The Deal

**Starting from the break:**
- East takes 4 tiles (2 stacks), then South, West, North
- Repeat until everyone has 12 tiles
- East takes tiles 1 and 5 from the next group (14 total)
- South, West, North each take 1 tile (13 total)

**Result:**
- East: 14 tiles (goes first)
- South, West, North: 13 tiles each

**All players rack their tiles and organize them by suit.**

---

## CHAPTER 6: THE CHARLESTON (STEP-BY-STEP)

The Charleston is American Mahjong's unique tile-passing ritual. It's your chance to improve your hand before play begins.

### What It Is

A structured series of tile passes where you:
1. Choose 3 tiles to pass
2. Pass them to specific players
3. Receive 3 tiles from others
4. Repeat several times

### Why It Exists

- Improves your starting hand
- Gets rid of unwanted tiles
- Starts shaping your hand toward the card

### The Three Passes (Mandatory)

**First Charleston:**

**Pass 1 - RIGHT**
- Choose 3 tiles you don't want
- Pass them to the player on your right
- Receive 3 tiles from your left

**Pass 2 - ACROSS**
- Choose 3 tiles
- Pass to the player across from you
- Receive 3 from across

**Pass 3 - LEFT**
- Choose 3 tiles
- Pass to the player on your left
- Receive 3 from your right

**Optional Second Charleston:**
After the first three passes, the group can vote to do a second Charleston (same pattern: Right, Across, Left).

**Optional Courtesy Pass:**
After all Charlestons, you may pass 0-3 tiles across to the player opposite you.

### Beginner Passing Strategy

**What to Pass:**

Pass tiles that:
- Don't fit any hand you're considering
- Are from suits you're not using
- Are isolated (single tiles with no matches)
- Are honors you don't need

**What to Keep:**

Keep tiles that:
- Form pairs (you have 2 of them)
- Form pungs (you have 3 of them)
- Are jokers (ALWAYS keep jokers)
- Fit multiple hand possibilities

**The #1 Rule:** Don't try to be perfect. Just get cleaner.

---

## CHAPTER 7: HOW TO PLAY A TURN

### Turn Structure

1. **Draw a tile** (from the wall)
2. **Evaluate your hand** (does this help?)
3. **Discard a tile** (announce it clearly)

OR

1. **Call a discard** (if someone throws what you need)
2. **Expose your meld** (show what you're making)
3. **Discard a tile**

### The Flow

- East goes first (has 14 tiles)
- East discards
- South draws and discards
- West draws and discards
- North draws and discards
- Repeat until someone wins

### When You Can't Win

If all tiles are drawn and nobody has won:
- The hand is a "wall game"
- No winner
- Reshuffle and start a new game

---

## CHAPTER 8: JOKERS 101

Jokers are wild cards, but they have rules.

### What Jokers CAN Do:

- Replace any tile in a **Pung, Kong, or Quint**
- Replace any tile in a **Run** (sequential tiles)
- Be swapped out if an opponent has the real tile (advanced rule)

### What Jokers CANNOT Do:

- Replace tiles in a **Pair**
- Replace **Flowers** or **Singles**
- Be used for isolated tiles

**Example:**

**Valid:**
- 5-5-Joker (Pung of 5s)
- 3-4-Joker-6-7 (Run with joker as 5)
- 8-8-8-Joker (Kong)

**Invalid:**
- 9-Joker (Pair—NO)
- Single Joker for a "2" requirement (NO)
- Joker for Flower tile (NO)

### The #1 Joker Mistake Beginners Make

**Mistake:** Using jokers for pairs or singles

**Fix:** Jokers only work in groups of 3+ tiles (pungs, kongs, runs, quints)

### Joker Strategy for Beginners

- **Keep your jokers through the Charleston**
- Use them to complete pungs/kongs
- Don't waste them early
- Having 2-3 jokers gives you huge flexibility

---

## CHAPTER 9: CALLING TILES + EXPOSURES

### When You Can Call a Tile

When any player discards a tile you need, you can:

**Call it** by saying the tile name aloud
- Example: "Three Crak!"

**Expose the meld** you're making with it
- Place the tiles face-up on your rack
- Include the joker if you're using one

**Discard a tile** from your hand

### What You Can Call For:

- **Pungs** (you have 2, need the 3rd)
- **Kongs** (you have 3, need the 4th)
- **Runs** (you need a specific tile to complete a sequence)
- **Mahjong** (the tile completes your entire hand)

### Calling Priority:

1. **Mahjong** (wins the game—highest priority)
2. **Exposure** (pung, kong, or run)
3. If two people call for exposure, the player closest to the discarder's right goes first

### When NOT to Call

**Don't call if:**
- It locks you into a hand you're not sure about
- You're still keeping options open
- The tile isn't critical yet
- You'd rather stay concealed for flexibility

**Beginner rule:** Only call when you're confident about your hand and the tile genuinely helps.

---

## CHAPTER 10: EXPOSURES

### What Exposing Means

When you call a tile and show your meld face-up on your rack, you've **exposed**.

### Pros of Exposing:

- Shows progress (psychological pressure)
- Prevents others from using those tiles
- Can speed up your hand completion
- Commits you to a path

### Cons of Exposing:

- Reveals your hand to opponents
- Reduces flexibility (you're locked in)
- Can't change hands easily
- Makes you a target for defensive play

### The Exposure Decision

**Expose when:**
- You're close to winning (1-2 tiles away)
- The tile is critical and rare
- You have jokers supporting your plan
- Your hand is clear and likely to finish

**Stay concealed when:**
- You're still undecided on your hand
- You have multiple possible hands
- It's early in the game
- You need very specific tiles later

---

## CHAPTER 11: WINNING, MAHJONG, AND END OF HAND

### Calling Mahjong

When you complete your hand:

1. **Call "Mahjong!"** immediately
2. **Lay your tiles face-up**
3. **Show which hand from the card you made**
4. Other players verify it's correct

### What Happens After a Win:

**If correct:**
- You score points (or collect payment)
- Winner becomes East for next game
- Tiles are reshuffled

**If incorrect (rare but happens):**
- You pay a penalty to all players
- Hand continues without you
- Be certain before calling Mahjong!

### Dead Hands

Your hand becomes "dead" if:
- You expose an invalid meld
- You pick up the wrong number of tiles
- You call Mahjong incorrectly

**Dead hand = you're out for that round**

### Common Table Etiquette:

- Announce discards clearly
- Don't rush other players
- Keep your tiles organized
- Be respectful if someone feeds you a win
- No gloating—everyone wins and loses

---

## CHAPTER 12: DALLAS MAHJONG / BLANKS VERSION (BEGINNER RULES)

Dallas Mahjong is a popular variation where **jokers can be swapped out** during play.

### What Blanks Are

"Blanks" usually refers to the jokers, which can be swapped when exposed.

### How Swapping Works

**If a player has exposed a meld with a joker:**

Another player can:
1. Take their turn normally (draw a tile)
2. **Before discarding**, swap the joker by giving the real tile
3. Take the joker into their hand
4. Then discard normally

**Example:**

You exposed: **6-6-Joker** (Pung of 6 Craks)

Opponent has a 6 Crak they don't need.

They can:
- Give you their real 6 Crak
- Take your joker
- Now you have 6-6-6 Craks (no joker)
- They have a joker to use elsewhere

### Important Rules:

**You CAN swap when:**
- The joker is in an exposed meld
- You have the exact tile the joker represents
- It's your turn

**You CANNOT swap:**
- Jokers in concealed hands
- Jokers after the player has discarded
- Multiple jokers in one turn (usually—check house rules)

### Beginner Safety Rules for Dallas Mahjong

1. **Only swap on YOUR turn** (after drawing, before discarding)
2. **Announce the swap clearly** ("Swapping for the 6 Crak joker")
3. **Place the real tile where the joker was**
4. **Take only one joker per turn** (most tables)

### Strategic Note:

Blanks/swapping speeds up the game. Players can get jokers mid-game, which increases surprise wins and changes defensive strategy.

### What Is Allowed vs. House Rules

**Standard (most tables):**
- One swap per turn
- Must use the exact tile
- Announce before swapping

**House rules (vary by table):**
- Some allow swapping multiple jokers
- Some require payment for swaps
- Some don't allow swapping at all

**Always ask before the game starts:** "Are we playing with swapping/blanks?"

---

## CHAPTER 13: BEGINNER STRATEGY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

### The FAST Framework

**F - Find the easiest hand**
Choose the hand that matches your current tiles, not the "coolest" hand on the card.

**A - Avoid dead tiles**
Don't chase tiles nobody has discarded. If your suit is getting burned, pivot.

**S - Stay flexible**
Keep 2 possible hands alive early. Don't commit until you have clear progress.

**T - Take progress**
When exposing helps you finish and doesn't kill flexibility, do it.

### 3 Beginner Hand Types to Target

**1. One Suit + Honors**
- Example: All Dots + Dragons
- Easier because you're focused
- Fewer tile types to track

**2. Pairs-Heavy Hands**
- Hands with lots of pairs
- Easier to build (pairs are common)
- Less hunting for exact singles

**3. Any Like Numbers**
- Example: 5-5-5 (any suits), 7-7-7 (any suits)
- Flexible—can use dots, bams, or craks
- More tiles available to complete

### Hands to Avoid as a Beginner

- Hands requiring 5+ exact singles
- Hands needing tiles you haven't seen
- Hands with complex requirements
- "Year" hands with unusual patterns

**Start simple. Win more.**

---

## CHAPTER 14: BEGINNER HAND SELECTION

### After the Charleston, Ask:

1. **What suits do I have the most of?**
2. **Do I have pairs or pungs already?**
3. **Which hands match my tiles RIGHT NOW?**
4. **Do I have jokers to help?**

### The Two-Hand Rule

Pick your **primary hand** (most likely) and a **backup hand** (Plan B).

Stay flexible until you have clear progress toward one.

### When to Commit

Commit to a single hand when:
- You've completed 2+ melds
- You're drawing tiles that fit
- You have jokers in place
- You're close to finishing (3-4 tiles away)

### When to Pivot

Switch hands when:
- Your tiles aren't coming
- Someone exposed your needed tiles
- Your suit is getting discarded heavily
- You're stuck after 10+ turns

**Don't be stubborn. Winning players pivot.**

---

## CHAPTER 15: CHARLESTON STRATEGY (BEGINNER)

### Your Charleston Goals:

1. **Cleaner hand** (fewer random tiles)
2. **More pairs** (building blocks)
3. **Focused suits** (1-2 suits, not all 3)

### What to Pass (in order):

**Pass 1 (Right):**
- Tiles from suits you're not using
- Isolated honors

**Pass 2 (Across):**
- More suit cleanup
- Tiles that don't fit top 2-3 hands

**Pass 3 (Left):**
- Final cleanup
- Anything clearly useless

### What to ALWAYS Keep:

- **Jokers** (never pass these)
- **Pairs** (2 identical tiles)
- **Pungs** (3 identical tiles)
- Tiles that fit your strongest 2 hands

### Don't Overthink It

The Charleston isn't about predicting the whole game. It's about **reducing chaos and creating options.**

**Beginner rule:** If you're not sure, pass it.

---

## CHAPTER 16: JOKER DISCIPLINE (BEGINNER)

### Rule #1: Keep Jokers Through Charleston

Never pass jokers. Ever. They're gold.

### Rule #2: Use Jokers for Hard-to-Get Tiles

Use jokers to complete:
- Pungs you're unlikely to finish naturally
- Kongs
- Critical parts of runs

Don't use them on tiles that are being discarded freely.

### Rule #3: Don't Expose Joker Melds Too Early

If you expose a meld with a joker, opponents can swap it out (Dallas rules).

Wait until you're close to winning before exposing joker-heavy melds.

### How Many Jokers Is Good?

- **0 jokers:** Tough but doable
- **1-2 jokers:** Standard, use wisely
- **3+ jokers:** Powerful—lean into faster hands

---

## CHAPTER 17: DEFENSE FOR BEGINNERS

### The #1 Defensive Rule:

**Don't feed wins.**

If someone is exposed and close, play carefully.

### How to Spot Danger:

**Player is dangerous if:**
- They have 2-3 exposures showing
- They're calling tiles quickly
- They look focused/confident
- They have jokers exposed

### Safe-ish Discards:

When someone looks close:
- Discard tiles already heavily thrown
- Discard tiles that don't match their exposures
- Avoid tiles in their "range"

### Example:

Opponent exposed: **3-3-3 Bams** and **Red Dragon-Red Dragon-Joker**

**Danger tiles:**
- Other Bams (they might need runs)
- Dragons (they might need more)

**Safer tiles:**
- Dots or Craks
- Tiles already discarded 3+ times

**Beginner rule:** When in doubt, discard what's already been thrown.

---

## CHAPTER 18: WHEN TO PIVOT VS. WHEN TO COMMIT

### Pivot Triggers (Change Hands):

1. **No progress after Charleston + 8 draws**
2. **Your needed tiles are being discarded**
3. **Two players exposed in your tiles**
4. **You need 4+ exact tiles you haven't seen**

### Commit Triggers (Stick with Hand):

1. **You have 2+ complete melds**
2. **You're 3-4 tiles from winning**
3. **You have jokers supporting the hand**
4. **Your tiles are coming regularly**

### The Sunk Cost Trap

**Mistake:** "I've been building this hand for 10 turns, I can't switch now!"

**Reality:** Those turns are gone. What matters is: **Can I win from here?**

If no, switch hands.

---

## CHAPTER 20: COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES (AND THE FIX)

### Mistake #1: Passing Jokers in Charleston
**Fix:** NEVER pass jokers. Keep them always.

**Fix:** If your hand isn't working after 10 turns, switch.

### Mistake #5: Feeding Wins
**Fix:** Watch exposed players and avoid their tiles.

### Mistake #6: Using Jokers for Pairs
**Fix:** Jokers only work in pungs, kongs, and runs.
