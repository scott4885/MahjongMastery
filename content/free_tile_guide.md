## CHAPTER 1: THE 3 TYPES OF MAHJONG SETS

### American Mahjong Sets
**What you need:** 166 tiles total
- Dots (1-9, four of each) = 36 tiles
- Bams (1-9, four of each) = 36 tiles
- Craks (1-9, four of each) = 36 tiles
- Winds (4 each: East, South, West, North) = 16 tiles
- Dragons (4 each: Red, Green, White) = 12 tiles
- Flowers (8 tiles, usually numbered 1-8)
- Jokers (8-10 tiles, usually blank/marked "JOKER")

**What's included in most sets:**
- Tile racks (4)
- Dice (2-4)
- Wind indicator (sometimes)
- Carrying case

### Chinese Mahjong Sets
**Do NOT buy these for American Mahjong**
- Only 144 tiles (not enough!)
- Different flower/joker system
- Missing tiles you need for NMJL play
- You'll end up buying a second set

### Universal/Hybrid Sets
**Can work, but check carefully**
- Some include both American and Chinese tiles
- Usually 152-166 tiles
- Verify it has all American requirements before buying

**BOTTOM LINE:** Look for sets specifically labeled "American Mahjong" or "NMJL compatible."

## CHAPTER 2: TILE MATERIALS (WHAT FEELS PREMIUM VS. WHAT CHIPS)

### Melamine (Budget-Friendly)
**Price range:** $40-$80

**Pros:**
- Affordable
- Lightweight
- Durable enough for casual play
- Easy to clean

**Cons:**
- Can feel "plastic-y"
- Lighter weight (less satisfying click)
- May yellow over time
- Edges can chip with heavy use

**Best for:** Beginners, travel sets, learning the game

### Acrylic (Mid-Range Standard)
**Price range:** $80-$150

**Pros:**
- Great balance of cost and quality
- Good weight and feel
- Resistant to scratches and yellowing
- Clear, crisp printing
- Satisfying "click" sound

**Cons:**
- Heavier than melamine (not ideal for travel)
- Can crack if dropped on hard surfaces

**Best for:** Regular home games, most players' "main set"

### Resin/Premium Materials (Luxury)
**Price range:** $150-$400+

**Pros:**
- Exceptional weight and feel
- Museum-quality appearance
- Most durable material
- Premium click sound
- Investment piece

**Cons:**
- Expensive
- Heavy (not portable)
- Overkill for beginners

**Best for:** Serious players, heirloom sets, weekly game hosts

**MY RECOMMENDATION:** Start with acrylic. It's the sweet spot for quality, durability, and price.

## CHAPTER 3: TILE SIZE & READABILITY

### Standard Size
**Tile dimensions:** Approximately 1.25" tall × 0.75" wide

**Good for:**
- Average-sized hands
- Standard tables
- Most portable

**Consider larger if:**
- Playing with people who have vision issues
- Hosting multigenerational games
- You have a large playing surface

### Large/Oversized Tiles
**Tile dimensions:** Approximately 1.5" tall × 1" wide

**Pros:**
- Much easier to read
- Great for older players
- Less eye strain
- Easier to handle

**Cons:**
- Requires larger racks
- Takes up more table space
- Heavier to transport
- Slightly more expensive

**THE TEST:** Can you read the numbers/symbols from 3 feet away in normal lighting? If not, consider larger tiles.

---

## CHAPTER 4: NUMBERS, COLORS, AND CLARITY

### High Contrast vs. Decorative

**High Contrast (Recommended for Beginners):**
- Bold, clear numbers
- Strong color differentiation
- Easy to distinguish suits
- Reduces mistakes

**Decorative/Artistic:**
- Beautiful designs
- Traditional artwork
- Can be harder to read quickly
- Better for experienced players

### Color Coding to Look For:

**Dots:** Usually green circles
**Bams:** Usually green bamboo sticks
**Craks:** Usually red numbers/characters

**Dragons:**
- Red Dragon: 紅 or solid red
- Green Dragon: 發 or solid green
- White Dragon: Often blank or with frame

**Flowers:** Usually numbered 1-8 with flower artwork

**Jokers:** Clearly marked "JOKER" or distinct symbol

**WATCH OUT FOR:**
- Tiles where 6 and 9 look similar
- Bams that look like dots from a distance
- Faded or light-colored printing
- Overly decorative tiles that slow down gameplay

---

## CHAPTER 5: RACKS & PUSHERS

### Rack Types

**Flat Racks:**
- Tiles sit flush
- More compact
- Harder to see your full hand at a glance

**Angled Racks (Recommended):**
- Tiles tilt back toward you
- Easier to scan your hand
- More comfortable for long games
- Industry standard for serious play

**What to check:**
- Smooth edges (no splinters)
- Stable base (doesn't tip)
- Holds all 14+ tiles comfortably
- Quality material (wood or sturdy plastic)

### Pushers

**What they do:** Help you line up tiles in a straight wall before dealing

**Do you need them?** No, but they're helpful
- Speeds up setup
- Creates neater walls
- Reduces tile handling
- Usually included in quality sets

**If buying separately:** $10-$20 for a set of 4

---

## CHAPTER 6: CARRYING CASE & STORAGE

### Essential Case Features:

**Must-haves:**
- Holds all 166 tiles
- Compartments for racks
- Space for dice and accessories
- Secure latches/zippers
- Handle for carrying

**Nice-to-haves:**
- Individual tile compartments (prevents shifting)
- Padded interior
- Card holder pocket
- Separate joker storage
- Shoulder strap

### Materials:

**Hard case:**
- Better protection
- Stackable
- More durable
- Heavier

**Soft case:**
- Lighter
- Easier to carry
- More storage pockets
- Less protection

**Travel consideration:** If you'll be bringing your set to different locations weekly, invest in a quality case with good handles and padding.

## CHAPTER 7: WHAT TO LOOK FOR WHEN BUYING USED

Buying used can save you 40-60%, but you need to check carefully.

### Missing Tiles Checklist

**Count everything:**
- 36 dots (9 numbers × 4 of each)
- 36 bams (9 numbers × 4 of each)

**Total: 152 minimum (166 with extra jokers)**

**Common missing tiles:**

**Can you replace missing tiles?** Sometimes, but it's difficult to match. Pass on sets missing more than 2-3 tiles.

### Condition Red Flags:

### Quick Test:

1. Lay out 5-10 tiles face down

3. Can you tell them apart by feel? (they should feel identical)
4. Flip them over—printing should be crisp and clear
5. Stack them—they should sit flat and stable

**Good deal range for used sets:**
