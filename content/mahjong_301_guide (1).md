## THE ADVANCED MINDSET

### You Are Not Playing Your Tiles

**Beginner mindset:** "What do my tiles need?"

**Intermediate mindset:** "What tiles are available?"

**Advanced mindset:** "What do my opponents need, what are they thinking, and how do I finish before they do?"

### You Are Playing Probability + People

**Probability:**
- Which tiles exist? Which have been discarded?
- What's the likelihood of drawing what I need?
- What's the probability each opponent can finish?

**People:**
- What patterns do my opponents follow?
- How can I manipulate their decisions?
- What information am I revealing, and what am I hiding?

**Master both, and you become unstoppable.**

---

## THE RANGE-BAIT-BLOCK-CLOSE FRAMEWORK

This is your advanced decision loop.

### RANGE
**Assign likely hands to each opponent**

Based on:
- Their Charleston passes
- Their discards
- Their exposures
- Their playing style

**Goal:** Narrow down what 2-3 hands they're likely building

### BAIT
**Use discards to test reactions**

Strategic discards that:
- Test if opponents want certain tiles
- Force reveals through calls or passes
- Create false information trails

**Goal:** Gain information while minimizing risk

### BLOCK
**Deny key tiles and stop wins**

Holding tiles that:
- Prevent opponents from completing hands
- Create roadblocks
- Force them to pivot or slow down

**Goal:** Control what tiles are available

### CLOSE
**Finish efficiently without exposure mistakes**

Endgame execution:
- Minimize risk while maximizing speed
- Close before opponents realize how close you are
- Avoid last-minute donations

**Goal:** Win before they see it coming

---

## CHAPTER 1: OPPONENT PROFILING

### The 5 Player Archetypes

**1. The Early Exposer**

**Traits:**
- Exposes 2-3 melds before turn 12
- Loves showing progress
- Often telegraphs their hand early

**Weaknesses:**
- Easy to read (you know their hand)
- Locked into one path
- Vulnerable to blocking

**How to exploit:**
- Read their exposures → guess their hand → block key tiles
- Let them expose first → stay concealed → finish while they're stuck
- Use their transparency against them

---

**2. The Joker Hunter**

**Traits:**
- Always swapping jokers (in Dallas rules)
- Prioritizes joker acquisition
- Builds joker-dependent hands

**Weaknesses:**
- Relies too heavily on jokers
- Wastes turns swapping instead of progressing
- Vulnerable if jokers dry up

**How to exploit:**
- Don't expose joker melds (deny swap opportunities)
- Force them to waste turns chasing swaps
- Finish while they're hunting jokers

---

**3. The Card Chaser**

**Traits:**
- Always playing "beautiful" or "unique" hands
- Chases difficult patterns
- Stubbornly refuses to pivot

**Weaknesses:**
- Low completion rate (hands are too hard)
- Doesn't adjust to tile availability
- Predictable (you can guess their hand from the card)

**How to exploit:**
- Let them chase impossible hands
- Block their key tiles
- Win with simpler hands while they struggle

---

**4. The Silent Killer**

**Traits:**
- Stays concealed
- Few/no exposures
- Quiet and patient
- Suddenly calls Mahjong

**Strengths:**
- Hard to read
- Flexible
- Dangerous

**How to counter:**
- Pay close attention to their discards (only clues you have)
- Assume they're close even if hidden
- Play defensively when they stop discarding freely

---

**5. The Chaos Passer**

**Traits:**
- Random Charleston passes
- Unpredictable discards
- No clear strategy
- Sometimes wins through luck

**Weaknesses:**
- Inconsistent
- Easy to outlast
- Often self-destructs

**How to exploit:**
- Play your game, ignore their chaos
- Capitalize on their mistakes (they'll donate wins)
- Be patient—they rarely close efficiently

---

### Profiling Your Table

**First 5 turns, ask:**
- Who exposed first? (Early Exposer)
- Who's swapping jokers? (Joker Hunter)
- Who's discarding strangely? (Chaos Passer)
- Who's concealed and quiet? (Silent Killer)
- Who's playing unusual hands? (Card Chaser)

**Adjust your strategy based on the table composition.**

---

## CHAPTER 2: READING THE TABLE (ADVANCED)

### Exposure Patterns by Section Type

**If opponent exposes:**

**Consecutive runs (e.g., 2-3-4, 5-6-7):**
- Likely: Consecutive Run section
- Watch for: More runs in same or different suits

**Like numbers (e.g., 5-5-5 in different suits):**
- Likely: Like Numbers or specific number section (2468, 13579)
- Watch for: Other numbers in the same pattern

**Winds (NNNN, EEEE):**
- Likely: Winds & Dragons section
- Watch for: More winds or dragons

**Pungs of same suit (3-3-3 Bams, 7-7-7 Bams):**
- Likely: Single-suit hand with pungs
- Watch for: More pungs in that suit

**Use exposure patterns to eliminate impossible hands and narrow their range.**

---

### Tile Temperature: Hot vs. Cold Tiles

**Hot tiles** = High-risk to discard
**Cold tiles** = Lower-risk to discard

**Hot (Dangerous):**
- Tiles matching opponent exposures
- Tiles in "wanted" range (middle numbers 3-7)
- Tiles nobody has discarded yet
- Tiles in active suits

**Cold (Safer):**
- Tiles discarded 3+ times
- Edge tiles (1, 9) when no runs showing
- Tiles outside opponent ranges
- Dead suits (heavily discarded)

**Advanced players track tile temperature in real-time.**

---

### Recognizing "Forced Hands"

**Forced hand = hand with very limited tile options**

**Example:**
Opponent needs: **FFFF 1111 9999 DDDD** (Flowers, Ones, Nines, Dragons)

**This hand is FORCED because:**
- Only 4 flowers exist (no substitutes)
- Only 4 of each One exist
- Only 4 of each Nine exist
- Only 4 of each Dragon exist

**Implication:** If you hold critical tiles (like a 1, 9, or Dragon), you can BLOCK them.

**Identify forced hands early → hold key tiles → deny their win.**

---

## CHAPTER 3: RANGE-BASED THINKING

### Assigning 2-3 Likely Hands to Each Player

**Based on:**
1. Charleston passes
2. Discards
3. Exposures
4. Card sections that match

**Example:**

**Opponent passes:** All Bams in Charleston
**Opponent discards:** More Bams, some Craks
**Opponent exposes:** EEEE (Four Easts)

**Your range assignment:**
- Hand A: Winds & Dragons section (confirmed by exposure)
- Hand B: Dots + Winds
- Hand C: Unlikely—Bams are dead for them

**You've narrowed their hand to 2-3 possibilities.**

---

### Updating Ranges Every 3 Turns

**Ranges aren't static—update them constantly.**

**Turn 5:** Opponent likely on Winds or Dots
**Turn 9:** Opponent discarded all Dots → Now ONLY Winds + Craks
**Turn 12:** Opponent exposed SSSS (Souths) → Confirmed Winds section

**By turn 12, you know their exact section and likely hand.**

**Use this to:**
- Block key tiles
- Avoid dangerous discards
- Predict their next moves

---

### What "Impossible Hands" Look Like

**Impossible = hands they can no longer complete**

**Example:**

**Opponent needs:** 111 222 333 (Pungs of Ones, Twos, Threes)

**Discards show:**
- Four 1-Bams already discarded
- Three 2-Craks already discarded

**Implication:** They can't complete this hand (too many needed tiles gone)

**If you recognize an impossible hand, they MUST pivot or lose.**

**Advanced move:** Force them into impossible hands by blocking tiles early.

---

## CHAPTER 4: DEFENSE THAT WINS GAMES

### The #1 Rule: Stop Donating Mahjongs

**Feeding wins costs you points AND gives opponents points.**

**Win by:**
1. Finishing first (best)
2. Finishing second (good)
3. Surviving to wall game (acceptable)
4. NOT feeding a win (critical)

**Advanced defense prioritizes #4 as much as #1.**

---

### Defensive Discard Sequencing

**Safest to riskiest (when opponents are close):**

**Tier 1 (Safest):**
- Tiles discarded 4+ times (virtually dead)
- Tiles completely outside opponent ranges

**Tier 2 (Relatively safe):**
- Tiles discarded 2-3 times
- Edge tiles (1, 9) if no runs exposed

**Tier 3 (Caution):**
- Tiles discarded once
- Tiles in cold suits

**Tier 4 (Danger):**
- Tiles matching exposures
- Tiles in hot suits
- Tiles nobody has thrown

**Tier 5 (Extreme danger):**
- Tiles that complete obvious patterns
- Tiles you're 90% sure they need

**Never throw Tier 5 unless you're desperate.**

---

### When to Break Your Own Hand to Survive

**Scenario:** Opponent exposed 3 melds, looks 1 tile from Mahjong

**Your hand:** Solid, but you're 4 tiles away

**Reality:** You can't win before they do

**Advanced move:** BREAK YOUR HAND to avoid feeding them

**Example:**

You have: 6-6-6 Craks (pung)

Opponent likely needs: 6 Crak (matches their exposures)

**Break the pung.** Discard one 6 Crak to hold two.

**Why?** Finishing second is better than donating a win.

**Ego hurts, but bankroll thanks you.**

---

## CHAPTER 5: BAITING + INFORMATION PLAYS

### Testing Discards

**Bait discard = throwing a tile to see if anyone wants it**

**Example:**

You think opponent might need 5 Bams.

**Test:** Discard 4 Bam or 6 Bam (adjacent tiles)

**If they call it:** They're on Bam runs → 5 Bam is DANGEROUS
**If they pass:** 5 Bam might be safer

**Use bait tiles (adjacent or related) to test without giving away the critical tile.**

---

### Controlling What You Reveal

**Everything you do reveals information:**

- **Discards** reveal what you're not using
- **Calls** reveal what you need
- **Exposures** reveal your hand direction

**Advanced players minimize reveals:**

**Bad:** Discard all Bams immediately (reveals you're not using Bams)

**Better:** Mix Bam discards with other suits (creates ambiguity)

**Best:** Discard tiles that could fit multiple hand types (maximal confusion)

---

### Creating False Trails (Without Being Reckless)

**False trail = making opponents think you're on a different hand**

**Example:**

**Your real hand:** Craks + Dragons

**False trail:** Discard a few Dots, then a few Bams, THEN switch to discarding Dots/Bams mix

**Effect:** Opponents think you might be on Dots or Bams, not Craks

**Caution:** Don't sacrifice your actual hand for deception. Only create false trails with tiles you genuinely don't need.

---

## CHAPTER 6: BLOCK STRATEGY

### Identifying the Key Tile(s) to Withhold

**Key tile = tile that, if held, prevents opponent from winning**

**Example:**

**Opponent exposed:** 2-2-2-2 Dots, 6-6-6-6 Bams

**Likely hand:** Like Numbers (needs 2s and 6s in all suits)

**Key tiles to block:** 2 Crak, 6 Crak (the suits they haven't exposed)

**If you hold these, they CAN'T win.**

---

### When Blocking Is Worth It

**Block when:**
1. Holding the tile doesn't hurt your hand
2. The opponent is close to winning
3. You have time to finish your own hand
4. The tile is genuinely critical to them

**Don't block when:**
1. It breaks your own hand
2. You're also close to winning (finish first instead)
3. Multiple opponents could win (can't block everyone)

**Blocking is a TOOL, not a default strategy.**

---

### How to Block Without Destroying Your Win Path

**Smart blocking:**

Hold tiles you don't need that they DO need.

**Example:**

**Your hand:** Bams + Dragons (no Craks needed)

**Opponent needs:** 7 Crak

**You have:** 7 Crak (useless to you)

**Action:** HOLD IT. It costs you nothing and blocks them.

**Dumb blocking:**

Breaking your own pungs to hold tiles for blocking.

**Don't sacrifice your win to block—only block with tiles you don't need.**

---

## CHAPTER 7: TEMPO CONTROL

### Speeding Up vs. Slowing Down the Game

**Tempo = the pace of the game**

**Fast tempo:**
- Early exposures
- Quick calls
- Aggressive play
- More risk

**Slow tempo:**
- Concealed hands
- Fewer calls
- Patient play
- More defense

**Advanced players manipulate tempo.**

---

### How Exposures Change Tempo

**When you expose:**
- Tempo speeds up (pressure increases)
- Opponents react (expose or defend)

**When you stay concealed:**
- Tempo slows (everyone waits)
- More cautious play

**Strategic use:**

**Behind?** → Speed up (expose early, force action)

**Ahead?** → Slow down (stay concealed, finish quietly)

---

### Winning by Forcing Mistakes

**Pressure creates mistakes.**

**How to create pressure:**

1. **Expose 2 melds early** (looks close)
2. **Call tiles quickly** (creates urgency)
3. **Discard confidently** (signals strength)

**Effect:** Opponents panic, make defensive mistakes, break their hands

**You win not because your hand was best, but because they self-destructed.**

---

## CHAPTER 8: HIGH-UPSIDE LINES (PLAYING FROM BEHIND)

### When to Chase Big Hands

**You're behind. Standard hands won't catch up.**

**Advanced move:** Chase a high-value or difficult hand

**Why?**
- Low probability, but HIGH reward
- If it hits, you win big
- You're losing anyway, so risk is acceptable

**When NOT to chase big hands:**
- You're ahead (stick with high-probability hands)
- You're in second place (stay solid)

**Chase big only when desperate.**

---

### Controlled Aggression

**Aggression ≠ Recklessness**

**Controlled aggression:**
- Calculated risks
- High-upside plays
- Backed by jokers or tile availability

**Reckless aggression:**
- Random exposures
- No backup plan
- Hope-based strategy

**Advanced players are aggressive WITH A PLAN.**

---

### Avoiding "Hero-Ball Mahjong"

**Hero-ball = trying to win every game with spectacular hands**

**Problem:** Low win rate, high variance

**Advanced approach:** Win MOST games with solid hands, occasionally win BIG when the situation calls for it

**Be aggressive when behind, be solid when ahead.**

---

## CHAPTER 9: ENDGAME WARFARE

### 8-Tiles-Left Decision System

**With 8 tiles left in the wall, evaluate:**

1. **Can I finish before tiles run out?**
   - If yes → Push aggressively
   - If no → Defensive mode

2. **How close are opponents?**
   - Multiple opponents exposed → High danger
   - All concealed → Moderate danger

3. **What tiles are left?**
   - Critical tiles still in wall → Keep going
   - Critical tiles already gone → Pivot or defend

**Make the call by turn 18-20 (roughly 8 tiles left).**

---

### What to Discard When Everyone Is Dangerous

**Nightmare scenario:** Three opponents exposed, all close

**Your options:**

**Safest tiles:**
1. Tiles discarded 4+ times
2. Tiles that don't match any exposures
3. Tiles in completely dead suits

**If no safe tiles exist:**
- Discard tiles least likely to complete patterns
- Break your own hand if necessary
- Accept you're playing for survival, not victory

**Sometimes the best play is "don't lose" instead of "try to win."**

---

### How to Win When You're Exposed and Close

**You're exposed with 2-3 melds. Opponents know you're close.**

**Now what?**

**Advanced tactics:**

1. **Finish FAST** (before they adjust defense)
2. **Don't telegraph your final tile**
   - If you need 5 Bam, don't obviously wait for it
   - Create ambiguity about what you need

3. **Discard confidently**
   - Don't hesitate (signals weakness)

4. **Use jokers aggressively**
   - Close before they block you

**Speed beats perfect defense.**

---

## CHAPTER 10: JOKER WARFARE

### Joker Swap Traps (Dallas Mahjong)

**Swap trap = exposing a joker meld to bait swaps, then using opponent's swap against them**

**Advanced trap:**

1. Expose: **6-6-Joker Bams**
2. Opponent swaps: gives you real 6 Bam, takes joker
3. You now have: **6-6-6 Bams** (no joker)
4. Opponent thinks they got a joker → BUT you never needed it

**Result:** They wasted a turn swapping, you didn't care

**Use when:** The joker wasn't critical to you, but they THINK it was

---

### Protecting Joker-Dependent Hands

**If your hand NEEDS jokers:**

**Protection tactics:**

1. **Don't expose joker melds until last**
   - Keep them concealed until 1 tile from Mahjong

2. **Use real tiles for exposures**
   - Expose real-tile pungs first
   - Hide joker melds

3. **Finish quickly after exposing jokers**
   - 1-2 turns max before they can swap

---

### How to Read Who Is Holding Jokers

**Joker tells:**

**Player likely has jokers if:**
- They're playing aggressively (jokers = confidence)
- They committed to a difficult hand (needs joker support)
- They haven't swapped any (if Dallas rules)
- They exposed joker melds (obvious)

**Player likely has NO jokers if:**
- They're playing conservatively
- They chose simple hands
- They're struggling to progress
- They've been swapping jokers (Dallas)

**Knowing who has jokers helps you predict who's dangerous.**

---

## CHAPTER 11: DALLAS MAHJONG / BLANKS ADVANCED ADD-ON

### Blank-Driven Threat Modeling

**With joker swapping, threat levels shift mid-game.**

**Standard threat model:**
- Opponent with 3 jokers = Very dangerous
- Opponent with 0 jokers = Less dangerous

**Dallas model:**
- Opponent with 0 jokers NOW could have 2 jokers in 3 turns (via swaps)
- Threat levels are FLUID, not static

**Adjustment:** Assume anyone can acquire jokers quickly. Don't rely on "they have no jokers" logic.

---

### Swapping Strategy and Counter-Strategy

**Offensive swapping (you're swapping):**
- Swap when it solves a real problem (not for marginal gains)
- Swap early in your turn (before discarding)
- Don't waste turns swapping tiles you'll barely use

**Defensive counter-swapping (preventing swaps):**
- Don't expose joker melds early
- Expose real-tile melds first
- Close before opponents can swap

**Meta-game:** If opponents are swap-happy, use it against them (let them waste turns while you finish)

---

### Defensive Blank Play Rules

**Defense with blanks is HARDER** (opponents can get jokers anytime)

**Rules:**

1. **Assume everyone is 1-2 tiles closer than they look**
   - Joker swaps speed up hands unpredictably

2. **Don't rely on "they can't finish without jokers"**
   - They might swap one next turn

3. **Play slightly more aggressive**
   - If defense is harder, offense (finishing first) becomes more valuable

**Adaptation is key.**

---

## CHAPTER 12: ADVANCED RULES OF THUMB (50+)

### Hand Selection
1. Choose hands where you already have 30%+ of the tiles
2. Avoid hands requiring tiles that are low-probability (flowers, specific honors in volume)
3. The best hand is the one you can finish, not the one that scores most
4. Tile availability trumps hand beauty
5. If two hands are equal, choose the one that's harder for opponents to block

### Charleston
6. Your Charleston passes should create ambiguity, not clarity (for opponents)
7. Mix suit passes to avoid telegraphing
8. Watch who's passing what (signals their direction)
9. If someone passes back exactly what you gave them, they're not using that suit
10. Coordinate with competent partners in team play (if applicable)

### Exposures
11. First exposure = information leak; second exposure = partial reveal; third exposure = transparency
12. Expose when concealment no longer provides value
13. Don't expose if it invites blocking
14. Expose rare tiles, hold common tiles
15. Concealed hands win more, exposed hands win faster (choose based on table tempo)

### Jokers
16. Jokers in concealed hands = max flexibility
17. Jokers in exposed hands = swap targets
18. Never expose joker melds when 5+ tiles from Mahjong
19. Use jokers for least-available tiles
20. With 5+ jokers, play the fastest hand possible

### Table Reading
21. First discard tells you least; tenth discard tells you most
22. Watch reaction times (hesitation = consideration)
23. Confident discards often signal safe tiles
24. Nervous discards often signal "I hope this is okay"
25. Silence (no calls) often means strong concealed hands or dead hands

### Defense
26. When two opponents are close, block the closer one
27. Feed the player in last place before feeding the leader
28. If you must feed someone, feed the player least likely to win again (balance table)
29. Breaking your hand to avoid feeding is often correct
30. Defensive play costs you wins but saves you points—net positive

### Timing & Tempo
31. Control tempo by controlling exposure pace
32. Speed up when behind, slow down when ahead
33. Force action when you're strong, delay when you're weak
34. Wall games favor patient players
35. Rushed games favor aggressive players

### Opponent Exploitation
36. Exploit Early Exposers by reading and blocking
37. Exploit Joker Hunters by denying swap opportunities
38. Exploit Card Chasers by letting them chase impossible hands
39. Respect Silent Killers (play cautiously)
40. Ignore Chaos Passers (they self-destruct)

### Blocking
41. Block only if it doesn't hurt you
42. Block when opponent is 1-2 tiles away
43. Block key tiles, not marginal tiles
44. If you can't block, finish first
45. Blocking is revenge for past losses (don't let emotion drive it)

### Endgame
46. With 6 tiles left, evaluate: Can I finish? If no, defend fully
47. Late-game pivots rarely work (commit earlier)
48. Desperate situations call for desperate hands
49. When everyone's close, the first to blink loses
50. The last tile drawn is the most dangerous to discard (everyone's waiting)

---

## CHAPTER 13: THE DRILL PACK (20 SCENARIOS)

### Scenario 1: Push or Defend?
**Situation:**
- You're 3 tiles from Mahjong
- Opponent A: Exposed 3 melds, looks 1 tile away
- Opponent B: Concealed, unknown
- 10 tiles left in wall

**Question:** Push for your win or play defensively?

**Answer:** DEFEND. Opponent A is closer (1 tile vs. your 3). You can't finish before they do. Play safe tiles, accept second place or wall game. Pushing now likely feeds Opponent A.

---

### Scenario 2: Push or Defend?
**Situation:**
- You're 2 tiles from Mahjong (have jokers)
- Opponent A: Exposed 2 melds, mid-progress
- Opponent B: Exposed 1 meld, early-stage
- 18 tiles left in wall

**Question:** Push or defend?

**Answer:** PUSH. You're closest (2 tiles + jokers). Opponents are behind. 18 tiles = plenty of draws. Finish aggressively before they catch up.

---

### Scenario 3: Pivot or Commit?
**Turn 16. Your hand:**
- Scattered tiles, no complete melds
- Need 6 specific tiles to finish
- Opponents: Two exposed and progressing

**Question:** Pivot or commit?

**Answer:** PIVOT (if a viable alternative exists) or DEFEND (if no alternatives). You're too far behind with 6 tiles needed. Commit to defense—don't feed wins.

---

### Scenario 4: What Tile Is Most Dangerous?
**Opponent exposed:**
- **3-4-5 Bams** (run)
- **7-7-7 Dots** (pung)

**Your hand includes:** 2 Bam, 6 Bam, 8 Bam, 7 Crak

**Question:** Which tile is MOST dangerous to discard?

**Answer:** **6 Bam**. Opponent exposed a Bam run (3-4-5), so they might need more Bams for additional runs (like 6-7-8 Bams). 2 Bam and 8 Bam are edge tiles (less likely to extend runs). 7 Crak doesn't match their exposures. **6 Bam is highest risk.**

---

### Scenario 5: What Hand Is She On?
**Opponent Charleston:**
- Passed all Craks
- Kept Bams and Dots

**Opponent discards:**
- Turn 1-5: More Craks, some honors
- Turn 6-10: Dots

**Opponent exposed:**
- **2-2-2-2 Bams** (kong)

**Question:** What section/hand is she likely on?

**Answer:** **Bams + honors** or **single-suit Bams**. She passed Craks (not using), discarded Dots (not using), exposed Bams (using). Likely on a Bam-heavy hand, possibly with Dragons or Winds. Watch for more Bam melds or honor exposures.

---

### Scenario 6: Block or Finish?
**You're 2 tiles from Mahjong.**
**Opponent exposed 3 melds, looks 1 tile away.**
**You hold a tile (5 Crak) that you suspect they need.**

**Question:** Hold 5 Crak to block them, or discard it to stay flexible for your finish?

**Answer:** **Finish first.** You're 2 tiles away; they're 1 tile away. Blocking buys time, but you might not draw in time anyway. Discard the 5 Crak, stay flexible, and race to finish. **Offense > Defense when you're close.**

---

### Scenario 7: Joker Swap Bait
**Dallas Mahjong. You exposed:**
- **8-8-Joker Craks**

**Opponent swaps, gives you real 8 Crak, takes joker.**

**Question:** Did this help or hurt you?

**Answer:** **Depends.** If you needed the joker for another meld, it HURT (you lost flexibility). If you didn't need the joker (you have enough real tiles), it HELPED (they wasted their turn, you got a real tile). **Expose joker melds strategically to avoid swaps when jokers matter.**

---

### Scenario 8: Reading Intent
**Opponent discarded:** 1 Bam, 2 Bam, 3 Bam, 4 Bam (over 8 turns)

**Question:** What does this tell you?

**Answer:** They're **NOT using Bams.** Heavy, consistent Bam discards signal they're on Dots/Craks or honors. **Bam tiles are safer to discard later** (they won't call them). Use this info to plan safe discards.

---

### Scenario 9: Exposure Timing
**Your hand:**
- 5-5-5 Dots (complete pung)
- 7-8-Joker Bams (run, almost complete)
- 2-2 Craks
- Random tiles

**Opponent discards:** 5 Dots

**Question:** Call and expose the pung of 5s?

**Answer:** **NO.** You're not close to winning (still need multiple tiles). Exposing now reveals your hand without meaningful progress. Stay concealed, keep building. Expose when you're 1-2 tiles away.

---

### Scenario 10: Defensive Sacrifice
**Opponent exposed 3 melds, announced "one tile away."**
**Your hand includes a pung:** 9-9-9 Bams
**You suspect they need 9 Bam.**

**Question:** Break your pung to avoid feeding them?

**Answer:** **YES, if you can't win first.** If you're 4+ tiles away and they're 1 tile away, you're losing this race. Breaking the pung to discard two 9 Bams safely (keeping one) prevents feeding them. **Second place > donating a win.**

---

### Scenario 11: Tempo Manipulation
**You're slightly ahead in progress.**
**Two opponents are slow/concealed.**

**Question:** Expose now to speed up the game, or stay concealed?

**Answer:** **Stay concealed.** You're ahead—no need to force action. Let opponents struggle quietly. Exposing speeds the game up and invites defensive pressure. **Slow tempo favors the leader.**

---

### Scenario 12: Baiting Info
**You think Opponent A might need 6 Dots.**

**Question:** How do you test this without throwing 6 Dots?

**Answer:** Discard **5 Dots or 7 Dots** (adjacent tiles). If they call it, they're on Dot runs → 6 Dots is DANGEROUS. If they pass, 6 Dots might be safer. **Bait with adjacent tiles to test.**

---

### Scenario 13: Range Assignment
**Opponent exposed:**
- **EEEE** (Four Easts)
- **WWWW** (Four Wests)

**Question:** What card section are they on?

**Answer:** **Winds & Dragons section.** They're collecting specific winds (Easts and Wests). Likely need more winds (North, South) or Dragons. **Avoid discarding winds and dragons.**

---

### Scenario 14: Late-Game Crisis
**Turn 22 (last 4 tiles in wall).**
**Three opponents exposed and close.**
**You're 5 tiles from winning.**

**Question:** What's your play?

**Answer:** **Full defense mode.** You cannot win (5 tiles, only 4 draws left). Your ONLY goal: don't feed wins. Discard only tiles already thrown 3+ times. Break your hand if necessary. **Survival > trying to win.**

---

### Scenario 15: Blocking Decision
**Opponent needs:** FFFF (Four flowers)
**You hold:** Flower 3, Flower 7 (you don't need them)
**Your hand:** 3 tiles from Mahjong

**Question:** Hold the flowers to block, or discard them?

**Answer:** **HOLD them.** Flowers are rare (only 8 exist). Holding two blocks them from completing FFFF. You don't need them, and you're close enough to finish. **Free blocking = smart play.**

---

### Scenario 16: Aggressive Line
**You're behind (two opponents ahead in progress).**
**Your hand options:**
- Hand A: Simple, 70% likely to complete
- Hand B: Difficult, 30% likely, but high-value

**Question:** Which hand?

**Answer:** **Hand B (high-upside).** You're behind—playing safe means second/third place. Take the risk. If Hand B hits, you win big and catch up. If it fails, you weren't winning anyway. **Play aggressive from behind.**

---

### Scenario 17: False Trail
**Your real hand:** Dots + Red Dragons
**You discarded:** 3 Bams, 2 Craks, 1 Bam

**Question:** What false trail are you creating?

**Answer:** You're suggesting you might be on Bams or Craks. Opponents might think you're NOT on Dots. This buys you time—they might discard Dots thinking you don't need them. **Effective misdirection.**

---

### Scenario 18: Joker Protection
**Your hand (concealed):**
- 4-4-Joker Bams
- 6-6-Joker Craks
- 9-9-9 Dots (real tiles)

**You're 1 tile from Mahjong. Which meld do you expose first?**

**Answer:** **9-9-9 Dots (real tiles).** Save joker melds for LAST. If you expose joker melds, opponents can swap them (Dallas rules). Expose real-tile melds first, then close quickly before swaps happen.

---

### Scenario 19: Opponent Tell
**Opponent hesitated for 5 seconds before discarding 7 Crak.**

**Question:** What does this tell you?

**Answer:** **Hesitation = consideration.** They thought about keeping it, meaning 7 Crak (or Craks in general) might be valuable to them. It's now a WARM tile—somewhat dangerous. **Watch for Crak-related hands.**

---

### Scenario 20: Meta-Game Adjustment
**Table composition:**
- Player A: Early Exposer
- Player B: Silent Killer
- Player C: Chaos Passer

**Question:** How do you adjust your strategy?

**Answer:**
- **vs. Player A:** Read their exposures, block key tiles
- **vs. Player B:** Play cautiously, assume they're close even if hidden
- **vs. Player C:** Ignore, focus on Players A & B

**Tailor strategy to opponent types.**

## CHAPTER 14: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

### Your Advanced Game Plan

**Pre-Game (Seating & Setup):**
- Profile opponents (archetypes)
- Note table dynamics (aggressive vs. passive)

**Charleston:**
- RANGE: Start assigning likely hands
- Pass strategically to create ambiguity
- Gather information from returns

**Early Game (Turns 1-10):**
- SCAN: Read discards and exposures
- SHAPE: Keep 2-3 hands viable
- Update opponent ranges every 3 turns

**Mid-Game (Turns 11-18):**
- COMMIT: Choose final hand by turn 12-14
- BAIT: Test discards to confirm reads
- BLOCK: Hold key tiles if it doesn't hurt you
- Update ranges continuously

**Late Game (Turns 19-24):**
- CLOSE: Execute efficiently
- DEFEND: If you can't win, don't feed
- Tempo control: Speed up if ahead, defend if behind

**This framework applies to EVERY GAME.**

---

## CHAPTER 16: ADVANCED MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake #1: Over-Profiling
**Problem:** Spending so much time reading opponents that you neglect your own hand

**Fix:** Profile quickly (5 turns max), then focus on execution

### Mistake #2: Blocking When You Should Finish
**Problem:** Holding tiles to block when you could finish first instead

**Fix:** Offense > Defense when you're close

### Mistake #3: False Trail Backfire
**Problem:** Creating misdirection that breaks your own hand

**Fix:** Only create false trails with tiles you genuinely don't need

### Mistake #4: Defensive Paralysis
**Problem:** Playing so defensively that you never win

**Fix:** Defend when opponents are closer; push when you're ahead

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Table Dynamics
**Problem:** Playing the same strategy regardless of opponent types

**Fix:** Adapt to table composition (aggressive vs. passive, experienced vs. beginners)
