## The Consistency Playbook
### Win More Without Getting Lucky

---

## WELCOME TO INTERMEDIATE STRATEGY

You know the rules. You've played dozens of games. You can read the card and finish hands.

**But you're frustrated because:**
- You lose to players who seem to know something you don't
- Your wins feel random, not repeatable
- You make the same mistakes over and over
- You can't figure out what the "good players" are doing differently

**This guide changes everything.**

You're about to learn the decision-making systems that separate casual players from consistent winners. These are the frameworks that strong players use—often without realizing it.

**What You'll Master:**
- The SCAN-SHAPE-COMMIT-DEFEND Framework
- Advanced hand selection (picking winners, not losers)
- Exposure strategy that actually works
- Joker management like a pro
- Table reading and opponent tells
- When to pivot vs. when to commit
- Defensive play that stops feeding wins

**By the end of this guide, you'll have a systematic approach to every decision.**

Let's get started.

---

## THE INTERMEDIATE SHIFT

### From "Playing a Hand" to "Playing the Table"

**Beginners ask:** "What tiles do I need?"

**Intermediate players ask:** "What tiles are available, what do my opponents need, and how do I finish first?"

### Why Intermediate Players Plateau

Most players get stuck because they:
1. Pick hands based on emotion, not probability
2. Expose too early or too late
3. Don't track what's been discarded
4. Play in a vacuum (ignoring opponents)
5. Lack a decision framework

**The good news:** These are all fixable with the right system.

### What Wins More Games: Flexibility + Timing

**Flexibility** = Keeping options open until the right moment
**Timing** = Knowing when to commit, when to pivot, when to push, when to defend

Master these two concepts, and your win rate jumps immediately.

---

## THE SCAN-SHAPE-COMMIT-DEFEND FRAMEWORK

This is your decision-making loop for EVERY game.

### SCAN
**Read the table + card options**

Before choosing a hand:
- What tiles did I keep through Charleston?
- What tiles am I drawing?
- What sections of the card match my tiles?
- What are opponents likely playing (based on Charleston)?

### SHAPE
**Build the most flexible version of your hand**

While keeping options alive:
- Hold "bridge tiles" that fit multiple hands
- Keep 2-3 possible hands in play
- Avoid locking in too early
- Build melds that overlap between hands

### COMMIT
**Choose the line and speed up**

When you have clear progress:
- Select your final hand
- Start building aggressively
- Use jokers strategically
- Expose when it accelerates without killing you

### DEFEND
**Stop feeding wins and protect position**

When opponents are close:
- Read danger tiles
- Discard safely
- Slow down if needed
- Finish second instead of donating a win

**This framework applies to EVERY SINGLE GAME.**

---

## CHAPTER 1: HAND SELECTION LIKE A PRO

### The Five Factors

**1. Tile Density (Most Important)**

Which tiles exist in abundance?

Example:
- You have: 4-4-4-5-6-7-8 Bams
- That's 7 Bams in a concentrated range
- HIGH DENSITY = Look for Bam runs or pungs

**Low density:**
- You have: 2 Dot, 7 Crak, North, Flower
- Random tiles = HARD to build

**Rule:** Choose hands supported by your tile density.

**2. Joker Count**

- 0 jokers = Choose hands with common tiles
- 1-2 jokers = Standard flexibility
- 3+ jokers = Aggressive/faster hands

**Why:** Jokers let you complete difficult melds. More jokers = more ambitious hands become viable.

**3. Early Draws**

Your first 3-4 draws tell you a lot.

Drawing:
- Pairs? → Pair-heavy hands
- Runs? → Run-based hands
- Honors? → Winds/Dragons hands

**Don't ignore early signals.**

**4. Charleston Outcomes**

What came back to you?

- Got back Dots? → Dots are available
- Got back Winds? → Others passing honors
- Got random junk? → Stay flexible longer

**5. Avoiding "Trap Hands"**

Trap hands LOOK good but are statistical nightmares.

**Red flags:**
- Requires 5+ exact singles
- Needs tiles that rarely get discarded
- Depends on perfect draws
- Has no joker flexibility

**Example trap hand:**
- FFFF 1111 9999 DDDD (Flowers, Ones, Nines, Dragons)
- Looks cool, but you need 4 flowers + exact pungs + dragons
- Probability = VERY LOW

**Better:** Choose hands with flexibility built in.

---

## CHAPTER 2: SHAPE - TILE EFFICIENCY + FLEXIBLE BUILDS

### Keeping Options Alive

**The 2-Hand Minimum Rule**

Until you're 60% toward one hand, keep TWO hands viable.

Example:
- Hand A: 111 222 333 DDD (Ones, Twos, Threes, Dragons)
- Hand B: 1111 2222 3333 (Ones, Twos, Threes—kongs)

**Your tiles:** 1-1-1-2-2-3-3-3-Red Dragon-Red Dragon

**You can build toward EITHER hand** until you commit.

### How to Hold "Bridge Tiles"

Bridge tiles fit multiple hands.

Example:
- You have: 5-6-7 Dots
- Hand A needs: 5-6-7-8 run
- Hand B needs: 4-5-6-7 run

**The 6-7 are bridge tiles.** They overlap both hands.

**Keep these as long as possible.**

### When a Hand Is Secretly Dead

**Dead hand signs:**
- You need 4 specific tiles, and 3 have been discarded
- Two opponents exposed your tiles
- You're on turn 15 and have made zero progress
- You'd need perfect draws for 6+ consecutive turns

**Don't be stubborn. Dead is dead.**

---

## CHAPTER 3: EXPOSURE STRATEGY (THE REAL RULES)

### When Exposures Help

**Expose when:**

1. **You're 3-4 tiles from winning**
   - Close enough that locking in is safe

2. **The tile is rare and won't come again**
   - Example: You need the 4th Red Dragon, someone throws it

3. **You have jokers backing you up**
   - Jokers give you flexibility even after exposing

4. **You can finish in 2-4 more draws**
   - Speed matters—get there first

### When Exposures Lock You In (Dangerous)

**Don't expose if:**

1. **You're still deciding between 2-3 hands**
   - Exposing kills your options

2. **You need multiple exact singles later**
   - Exposing won't help; you'll still need perfect draws

3. **You're early (before turn 8-10)**
   - Too soon; you don't have enough information

4. **The table is moving slow**
   - No pressure = stay concealed longer

### The "One Exposure" Advantage

**One exposure** puts pressure on opponents without fully revealing your hand.

Example:
- You expose: **6-6-6 Craks**
- Opponents know you're on Craks, but don't know:
  - Are you doing runs?
  - Kongs?
  - Mixed suits?

**Strategic ambiguity = power.**

### When to Stay Concealed Longer

**Stay concealed when:**
- You're winning the race (ahead of others)
- You want to hide your direction
- You can finish without exposing
- Opponents are aggressive (let them expose and fight)

**Concealed wins are often safer wins.**

---

## CHAPTER 4: JOKER MANAGEMENT (INTERMEDIATE LEVEL)

### Playing Joker-Rich vs. Joker-Poor

**With 0-1 Jokers:**
- Choose common-tile hands
- Avoid trap hands
- Focus on hands with high tile availability
- Play conservatively

**With 2-3 Jokers:**
- Standard strategy
- Use jokers for hard-to-complete melds
- Moderate aggression

**With 4+ Jokers:**
- AGGRESSIVE strategy
- Target faster hands
- Expose earlier (you have backup)
- Push tempo

### When to Chase a Joker Swap

**In Dallas Mahjong (blanks), you can swap jokers from exposed melds.**

**Chase a swap when:**
- You have the exact tile
- The joker solves a critical problem
- It's your turn and low-risk

**Don't chase when:**
- The swap doesn't meaningfully help
- You'd have to break your hand to get the tile
- The player is close to Mahjong (they might win before you use it)

### How to Avoid Joker Bait Mistakes

**Joker bait = exposing jokers too early, making them swap targets**

**Protect jokers by:**
- Exposing joker melds LAST (when you're 1-2 tiles from Mahjong)
- Using real tiles for early exposures
- Keeping joker melds concealed longer

**Example:**

You have:
- 5-5-5 Bams (real tiles)
- 8-8-Joker Craks (one joker)

**Expose the Bams first.** Save the joker meld for when you're close.

---

## CHAPTER 5: CHARLESTON STRATEGY (INTERMEDIATE)

### Passing with Intention

Intermediate Charleston isn't random cleanup—it's **strategic shaping**.

### Pass 1 (Right): Information Gathering

**What to pass:**
- Tiles from suits you're definitely not using
- Isolated honors

**What to watch:**
- What came back? (Signals what's available)

### Pass 2 (Across): Directional Commitment

**What to pass:**
- Tiles from your weaker hand option
- Tiles you're 80% sure you won't need

**What to watch:**
- Are you getting your suit back? (Bad sign)
- Are you getting honors? (Others not using them)

### Pass 3 (Left): Final Refinement

**What to pass:**
- Last cleanup of unusable tiles

**What to keep:**
- Jokers (always)
- Tiles for your top 2 hands
- Bridge tiles

### "Information Passing" vs. "Tile Dumping"

**Tile dumping (beginner):**
- "I don't want this, pass it"

**Information passing (intermediate):**
- "If I pass this and get it back, I know it's abundant"
- "If I pass honors and get honors back, few are using them"

**You're gathering data, not just cleaning.**

### What Your Passes Reveal (To Others)

**Passing lots of one suit = you're not using that suit**

Example:
- You pass 3 Bams every round
- Smart opponents know: Don't discard Bams later (you won't call them)

**Strategic consideration:** Mix your passes slightly to avoid being too readable.

---

## CHAPTER 6: TABLE READING 101

### What Discards Tell You

**Early discards (Turns 1-8):**
- Random cleanup
- Suits they're not using
- Isolated honors

**Mid-game discards (Turns 9-15):**
- More intentional
- Tiles that don't fit their hand
- Defensive throws (if someone exposed)

**Late-game discards (Turns 16+):**
- Highly defensive
- "Safe" tiles (already thrown)
- Desperation (breaking their hand to avoid feeding)

### Identifying Likely Sections of the Card

**Look at exposures:**

**Exposed: 3-3-3 Dots and 7-7-7 Dots**
- Likely: Like Numbers section (same number, different suits)
- Possible: Consecutive section with Dot runs

**Exposed: NNNN (4 Norths)**
- Likely: Winds & Dragons section

**Exposed: 2-4-6-8 Craks**
- Likely: 2468 section

**Use exposures to narrow down their hand range.**

### Spotting Who Is Close

**Danger signs:**
- 2+ exposures showing
- Calling tiles quickly
- Discarding "safe" tiles only
- Looking confident (body language)
- Has jokers exposed

**When you spot danger, adjust your discards.**

---

## CHAPTER 7: TIMING - WHEN TO PIVOT VS. WHEN TO COMMIT

### The 3 Pivot Triggers

**1. No Progress After 12 Draws**
- You're not getting closer
- Your tiles aren't coming
- Time to switch

**2. Your Tiles Are Being Discarded**
- Multiple players throwing your suit
- Sign: it's dead
- Find another path

**3. Two Players Exposed in Your Territory**
- They've claimed your tiles
- You're now fighting for scraps
- Pivot to different tiles

### The "Last Responsible Moment" Rule

**Commit as late as possible, but not too late.**

**Last responsible moment = when:**
- You have 2 complete melds
- You can see a clear path to finish
- Waiting longer doesn't help

**Too early:** Turn 5 (not enough info)
**Too late:** Turn 18 with nothing (should have pivoted by turn 12)
**Just right:** Turn 10-14 (with clear progress)

### Avoiding the Sunk Cost Trap

**Sunk cost fallacy:**
"I've been building this hand for 15 turns, I can't give up now!"

**Reality:**
Those 15 turns are GONE. They don't matter.

**What matters:** Can you win from HERE?

If no → Pivot
If yes → Commit

**Don't throw good turns after bad.**

---

## CHAPTER 8: DEFEND - STOP FEEDING THE TABLE

### Safe-ish Discards

**No discard is 100% safe, but some are safer:**

**Safest:**
- Tiles already discarded 3+ times
- Tiles nobody has called
- Tiles outside exposed ranges

**Dangerous:**
- Tiles matching exposures
- Tiles in "hot" suits
- Tiles nobody has thrown (everyone might want them)

### Danger Tiles

**High-risk throws:**

**When someone exposed Bam runs:**
- Other Bams (they might need more)

**When someone exposed 5-5-5:**
- Other 5s in different suits (if playing Like Numbers)

**When someone exposed Dragons:**
- Other Dragons (might need more)

### How to Play When Someone Is Exposed and Hot

**Defensive checklist:**

1. **Stop discarding tiles in their range**
   - If they exposed Craks, avoid Craks

2. **Discard tiles already heavily thrown**
   - Safe-ish choices

3. **Slow down your own hand if needed**
   - Better to finish second than donate a win

4. **Watch for their final tile needs**
   - If they need one more tile, don't be the one to throw it

### The Defensive Discard Sequence

**Safest to riskiest:**

1. Tiles discarded 4+ times (nearly dead)
2. Tiles discarded 2-3 times (probably not wanted)
3. Honors nobody called (if not in Winds/Dragons hands)
4. Edge tiles (1s, 9s) if no runs showing
5. Middle tiles (4, 5, 6) ONLY if confident

**When in doubt, throw what's been thrown.**

---

## CHAPTER 9: ENDGAME DECISIONS

### How to Finish a Hand

**You're 2-3 tiles away. Now what?**

**Aggressive finish:**
- Expose remaining melds
- Use jokers
- Call any helpful tile
- Push tempo

**When to use:** You're ahead, or table is slow

**Conservative finish:**
- Stay concealed
- Wait for perfect draws
- Don't expose unless critical

**When to use:** Opponents are also close, or you're slightly behind

### When to Push

**Push when:**
- You're closest to winning
- You have jokers
- Opponents are slower
- You can finish in 2-4 draws

### When to Freeze and Survive

**Freeze when:**
- Two players are exposed and racing
- You can't win
- Your goal is "don't donate a win"

**Freeze tactics:**
- Discard only safe tiles
- Break your own hand if needed
- Play for second place (or wall game)

**Sometimes the best move is NOT winning—it's NOT LOSING.**

---

## CHAPTER 10: DALLAS MAHJONG / BLANKS STRATEGY ADD-ON

### How Blanks Change Risk

**With joker swapping:**
- Players can acquire jokers mid-game
- Hands speed up unpredictably
- "Safe" tiles become less safe

**Implication:** Games are faster and more volatile.

### How to Defend When Blanks Exist

**Standard defense assumes:** Players keep the jokers they started with

**With blanks:** Players can GET jokers from exposures

**Defense adjustment:**
- Assume anyone can suddenly speed up
- Don't rely on "they don't have jokers" logic
- Play slightly more aggressively (since others will too)

### When Blanks Create Fake Safety

**Fake safety:**
"They need 3 more tiles and have no jokers—I'm safe"

**Reality with blanks:**
"They could swap a joker this turn and suddenly need only 1 tile"

**Adjustment:** Stay cautious even when opponents seem far behind.

---

## CHAPTER 11: INTERMEDIATE RULES OF THUMB (30+)

### Hand Selection
1. Tile density beats hand beauty
2. Jokers multiply your options—use them wisely
3. Avoid hands requiring 4+ exact singles
4. Trust your early draws
5. If you can't name 2 viable hands post-Charleston, you're in trouble

### Charleston
6. Never pass jokers
7. Pass isolated tiles first, suits second, honors last
8. Watch what comes back—it signals availability
9. Keep bridge tiles that fit multiple hands
10. Don't commit mentally until after Charleston

### Exposures
11. One exposure = pressure; three exposures = transparency
12. Expose rare tiles, not common ones
13. Don't expose before turn 10 unless you're loaded
14. If exposing locks you into needing exact singles, don't expose
15. Concealed wins are often better wins

### Jokers
16. Save jokers for pungs/kongs, not runs (when possible)
17. Don't expose joker melds until you're 1-2 tiles from Mahjong
18. With 4+ jokers, play aggressively
19. With 0 jokers, play conservatively
20. Joker swaps (blanks) are only worth it if they solve a real problem

### Table Reading
21. Early discards = cleanup; late discards = defense
22. Watch exposure patterns to guess card sections
23. If two players throw the same tile back-to-back, it's probably dead
24. Silence (no exposures) often means strong concealed hands
25. Exposed players are easier to read

### Timing
26. Pivot by turn 12 if you have no progress
27. Commit when you have 2 complete melds
28. The hand that's 70% built beats the hand that's 30% perfect
29. Don't chase perfection; chase completion
30. Wall games (no winner) often result from everyone waiting too long

## CHAPTER 12: PRACTICE PACK - 10 SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Early Decision
**Your tiles (post-Charleston):**
- 2-2-2-3-4-5-6-6 Bams
- Red Dragon, Red Dragon
- 1 Crak
- Joker, Joker

**Card hands available:**
- Hand A: 222 333 444 DDDD (Pungs + Dragons)
- Hand B: 2345 6789 (Bam runs)

**Question:** Which hand do you choose, and why?

**Answer:** Hand B (Bam runs). You have high Bam density and a natural run started (2-3-4-5-6). Hand A requires you to build pungs of 3s and 4s from scratch. Hand B leverages your current tiles.

---

### Scenario 2: Exposure Decision
**Your hand:**
- 7-7-7 Dots (concealed)
- 5-6-Joker-8 Craks (concealed run)
- 9-9 Bams
- 3 Crak, North, South

**Opponent discards:** 7 Dots

**Question:** Do you call and expose the pung of 7 Dots? Why or why not?

**Answer:** NO. You're not close to winning (still need multiple tiles), and exposing now reveals you're on Dots/Craks without meaningful progress. Stay concealed and keep building.

---

### Scenario 3: Pivot or Commit?
**Turn 14. Your hand:**
- 1-1 Bams, 4-4 Bams, 7 Bams (scattered)
- 2-2 Craks
- North, South, West
- Joker

**Discards show:** Bams have been heavily thrown (8+ Bam tiles discarded)

**Question:** Pivot or stay the course?

**Answer:** PIVOT. Bams are dead (heavily discarded). Your tiles are scattered with no complete melds. Look for a hand using Craks or Winds instead.

---

### Scenario 4: Defensive Discard
**Table situation:**
- Opponent exposed: **4-4-4 Craks** and **EEEE (Easts)**
- They look close

**Your hand includes:** 4 Dots, 5 Craks, 8 Bams, White Dragon

**Question:** Which tile do you discard, and why?

**Answer:** 8 Bams. It doesn't match their exposures (Craks and Easts). 5 Craks is DANGEROUS (they might need more Craks for runs). 4 Dots could be risky if they're on Like Numbers (4s). White Dragon could be risky if they need Dragons. 8 Bams is safest.

---

### Scenario 5: Joker Usage
**Your hand:**
- 3-3-3 Dots (real tiles)
- 6-6-Joker Craks (pung with joker)
- 2-2-2 Bams (real tiles)
- Need: 1 more pung to finish

**Question:** When do you expose the joker meld (6-6-Joker)?

**Answer:** LAST. Expose the real-tile pungs first (3-3-3 and 2-2-2). Only expose the joker meld when you're 1 tile from Mahjong. This prevents opponents from swapping your joker (in Dallas rules) and keeps your flexibility.

---

### Scenario 6: Charleston Intelligence
**Pass 1 (Right):** You passed 3 Craks
**You received:** 3 Craks back

**Question:** What does this tell you?

**Answer:** Craks are abundant / not being used by the player on your left. This is a POSITIVE signal—Craks may be available later in the game. Consider Crak-based hands.

---

### Scenario 7: Reading Exposures
**Opponent exposed:**
- **2-2-2-2 (Kongs of 2s, any suits)**
- **6-6-6-6 (Kongs of 6s, any suits)**

**Question:** What section are they likely playing?

**Answer:** Even Numbers or Like Numbers section. They're collecting the same numbers across different suits. Avoid discarding 2s and 6s in any suit.

---

### Scenario 8: Late-Game Push or Defend?
**Turn 20. Your hand:**
- Exposed: 5-5-5 Bams
- Concealed: 8-8-8 Dots, 2-2 Craks, 9 Crak, North, Joker
- Need: 2 Craks or North to complete hand

**Opponent 1:** Exposed 3 melds, looks 1 tile away
**Opponent 2:** Concealed, no info

**Question:** Push aggressively or play defense?

**Answer:** DEFEND. Opponent 1 is likely closer than you (3 exposures vs. your 1). Play safe tiles—avoid Craks and Norths if possible. Breaking your hand slightly to avoid feeding a win is worth it. Finish second, don't donate first.

---

### Scenario 9: Blanks Strategy
**Dallas Mahjong. Opponent exposed:**
- **7-7-Joker Bams**

**You have:** 7 Bams (the real tile)

**Your hand status:** You need the joker to complete a critical pung elsewhere

**Question:** Do you swap? When?

**Answer:** YES, but ONLY on your turn, right after drawing and before discarding. Give them your 7 Bams, take the joker, then discard. Make sure swapping doesn't break your hand structure. Only swap if the joker genuinely solves a problem.

---

### Scenario 10: Hand Selection Under Pressure
**Post-Charleston:**
- 5-6-7-8-9 Craks (strong run)
- Red Dragon, Red Dragon, Red Dragon
- 1-1 Bams
- Joker, Joker

**Available hands:**
- Hand A: 56789 + DDDD (Run + Dragons)
- Hand B: 111 222 333 DDDD (Pungs + Dragons)

**Table:** Two players already exposed Bams

**Question:** Which hand?

**Answer:** Hand A. You have the run nearly complete (5-6-7-8-9 Craks) and a dragon pung ready (Red-Red-Red). Hand B requires you to build pungs of 1s, 2s, 3s from scratch, and Bams are already being fought over. Leverage your current strength.
