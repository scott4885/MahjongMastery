## Post 1: Never Pass the Jokers
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook
**Type:** Mistake
**Hook (first line):** The fastest way to regret a Charleston? Passing a joker 😅
**Caption:** I know it’s tempting to “clean up” your hand… but jokers are gold. ✨ Keep them through every Charleston pass, even if your hand looks messy. Jokers turn a “meh” hand into a winning hand fast. Next time you see that little JOKER tile, hug it, don’t toss it! 🃏💛

## Post 2: Exposing Too Early
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook
**Type:** Mistake
**Hook (first line):** Expose too early and you basically hand out your game plan 🙈
**Caption:** If you’re only 1 meld in and you expose, you’re locked in and your opponents know exactly what to block. Wait until you’re 3–4 tiles from Mahjong before flashing those tiles. Patience = power. 🧘‍♀️🀄️

## Post 3: Pretty Hand Trap
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook
**Type:** Mistake
**Hook (first line):** “That hand is so cute!” …and so hard to finish 😬
**Caption:** We’ve all done it—chasing the “pretty” hand instead of the easy one. Winning hands are about completion, not beauty. Pick the hand that matches your tiles NOW, not the one that looks fancy on the card. 💅➡️🏆

## Post 4: Three-Suit Chaos
**Platform:** Facebook/Instagram
**Type:** Mistake
**Hook (first line):** If you’re holding Dots, Bams, AND Craks in turn 10… we need to talk 😅
**Caption:** Holding 3 suits too long is a classic beginner trap. By mid‑game, narrow to 1–2 suits so your draws actually help you. Fewer suits = faster wins. 🔥

## Post 5: Feeding Wins
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook
**Type:** Mistake
**Hook (first line):** The worst feeling: realizing YOU just gave someone Mahjong 😭
**Caption:** If someone has 2+ exposures, stop tossing tiles in their suit. Play boring. Throw safe tiles already discarded 3+ times. Defense wins games (or at least stops you from donating them). 🛡️🀄️

## Post 6: The FAST Framework
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook/TikTok
**Type:** Tip
**Hook (first line):** Stuck mid‑game? Use FAST like a pro 🚀
**Caption:** FAST = Find the easiest hand, Avoid dead tiles, Stay flexible, Take progress. If you do JUST this, your win rate goes up. Try it for your next 5 games and tell me what changes. 😉

## Post 7: Two‑Hand Rule
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook
**Type:** Tip
**Hook (first line):** Keep TWO hands alive early = more wins later 💡
**Caption:** Don’t marry a hand on turn 3. Keep a primary and backup hand until you have clear progress. It keeps you flexible and saves you from dead ends. Think of it as Mahjong insurance. ✅

## Post 8: Safe Discard Shortcut
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook
**Type:** Tip
**Hook (first line):** Quick defense trick: discard what’s already been discarded ✅
**Caption:** When someone is exposed and racing, play it safe. Tiles already thrown 3+ times are *usually* safer than fresh tiles. Not perfect, but better than feeding a win. 😅

**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook/TikTok
**Type:** Did You Know
**Hook (first line):** Did you know jokers can’t be used in pairs? 🃏🙅‍♀️
**Caption:** Jokers only work in Pungs, Kongs, Runs (groups of 3+). They can’t replace a pair or a single. This one rule fixes SO many beginner mistakes. Save those jokers for your big sets. 💥
