## Post 21: Monday Motivation
**Caption**:
```
Happy Monday, Mahjong friends! 🀄

This week's goal: Play at least ONE game where you commit to a hand early and DON'T second-guess yourself.

Trust your instincts. Confidence wins games. 💪

Drop a 🀄 if you're in!

## Post 22: Common Question
**Caption**:
```
"When should I expose my first meld?"

Short answer: When you're 3-4 tiles from Mahjong and have a solid backup hand.

Long answer: If you expose too early (turn 5-6), everyone knows your strategy and will block you. Wait until you have momentum. ⚡

What's YOUR rule for exposing?

## Post 23: Tile Tuesday

TILE TUESDAY! 🎴

Fun fact: The NMJL card changes every year, but some patterns show up season after season.

2468, Consecutive Runs, and Winds/Dragons are the "reliable classics" — they're almost always there in some form.

What's your favorite recurring pattern? 👇

## Post 24: Mistake Monday
**Caption**:
```
Mistake I see ALL THE TIME: Breaking up a pung/kong to chase a different hand.

Once you have 3-4 of the same tile, COMMIT. That's progress. Don't throw it away chasing a "prettier" hand. 🎯

Stick with what's working!

## Post 26: Charleston Clinic
**Caption**:
```
CHARLESTON CLINIC: What to pass FIRST ⚡

In the first pass (Right), get rid of:
1. Tiles you have only 1 of (no pairs, no potential)
2. Winds/Dragons if they don't match your strategy
3. Anything from a suit you're NOT building

Keep jokers, pairs, and "flexibles" (tiles that work in multiple hands).

## Post 27: Hump Day Humor
**Caption**:
```
Halfway through the week... just like that moment mid-Charleston when you realize you passed a tile you NEEDED. 😭

We've all been there. What's the tile you regretted passing most? Mine: a joker. Still haunts me. 🃏💔

## Post 28: Pro Tip Thursday
**Caption**:
```
PRO TIP THURSDAY 🎯

Watch what tiles get passed during the Charleston. If everyone is dumping Bams, that suit is hot garbage this round. Don't build a Bam hand.

The Charleston tells you what NOT to do. Pay attention. 👀

```
SUNDAY STRATEGY SESSION 🀄

Pop quiz: You have 2 exposures showing and you're 2 tiles from Mahjong. Do you:

A) Keep discarding safe tiles (defensive)
B) Go aggressive and throw what you need to win (offensive)

Answer: B! You're so close. Take the risk. Force them to play defense against YOU. 🔥
