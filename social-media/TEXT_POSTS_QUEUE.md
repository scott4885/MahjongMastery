## Post 11: Game Night Conversation Starter
**Caption**:
```
What's the ONE Mahjong rule your friends ALWAYS forget? 👀

Mine: You can't call a tile for an exposure unless it completes a pung, kong, or quong. No "I need it for later!" 😂

Drop yours in the comments! Let's commiserate together. 🀄

## Post 12: Quick Win Story
**Caption**:
```
This week's WIN: A student went from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to calling Mahjong in 6 turns. 🎉

Her secret? She picked ONE simple hand from the card (2468 in all suits) and committed HARD. No second-guessing, no switching mid-game.

Beginner tip: Pick the easiest hand that matches your tiles. Perfection is the enemy of progress. 🏆

## Post 13: Myth Buster
**Caption**:
```
MYTH: "You need a lot of luck to win at Mahjong."

TRUTH: Luck gets you tiles. STRATEGY gets you wins. 🎯

The difference? Knowing:
✅ Which hands to commit to early
✅ When to pivot (and when to stick)
✅ How to read your opponents' discards

Win more with what you're dealt. That's skill, not luck. 💪

## Post 14: Charleston PSA
**Caption**:
```
Charleston PSA: Stop passing tiles you "might need later." 🛑

If it doesn't help you NOW, it's dead weight. Pass it confidently and make room for tiles that actually move you forward.

Your Charleston should be strategic, not sentimental. 💼

Who else holds onto tiles way too long? Just me? 😅

## Post 16: Defense Tip
**Caption**:
```
DEFENSE TIP: If someone has 2+ exposures showing, STOP feeding their suit. 🛑

They're locked in. You know EXACTLY what they need. Don't be the one who gives them Mahjong.

Play boring. Throw safe tiles (already discarded 3+ times). Defense wins games. 🛡️

## Post 17: Beginner Mistake
**Caption**:
```
Beginner mistake I see ALL THE TIME: Holding 3 suits too long. 🎴

By turn 10, you should be down to 1-2 suits MAX. Holding Bams, Craks, AND Dots means nothing you draw will help you.

Narrow your focus early = faster wins. ✨

## Post 18: Joker Wisdom
**Caption**:
```
Joker wisdom: They're called JOKERS, not "tiles I'll use eventually." 🃏

If you have a joker and you're NOT using it immediately, you're playing too cautiously.

Jokers = instant progress. Use them. Expose. Take control. 💥

## Post 19: Table Talk Question
**Caption**:
```
Real talk: Do you prefer to play FAST (make quick decisions, keep the game moving) or SLOW (think through every discard)?

I'm team FAST. Overthinking = second-guessing = dead hands. ⚡

What about you? Are you a speedy player or a strategic slow-burner? 🤔

## Post 20: Friday Motivation
**Caption**:
```
Happy Friday! 🎉

This weekend, challenge yourself: Play a hand you've NEVER played before.

We all have our "safe" hands. But growth happens when you try something new. Even if you don't win, you'll learn something. 📚

Tag someone who needs to step out of their Mahjong comfort zone! 👇
